# Decentralized Sustainable Sourcing Verification (DSSV)

A blockchain-based platform for transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy sustainability claims throughout global supply chains.

## Overview

DSSV transforms supply chain sustainability by leveraging blockchain technology to create an immutable and transparent verification ecosystem. The system enables suppliers, auditors, certifying bodies, brands, and consumers to participate in a trusted network that verifies environmental and social sustainability claims, reducing greenwashing and building authentic market differentiation.

## Core Components

### 1. Supplier Verification Contract

Validates and authenticates legitimate vendors within the sustainable sourcing ecosystem.

- **Identity Verification**: Confirms supplier legitimacy through decentralized credentials
- **Facility Registry**: Records production locations with precise geospatial data
- **Capacity Documentation**: Verifies production volumes and capabilities
- **Ownership Structure**: Tracks corporate relationships and ultimate beneficial owners
- **Historical Performance**: Maintains records of past sustainability performance

### 2. Standards Compliance Contract

Records and manages adherence to specific sustainability criteria and frameworks.

- **Standards Mapping**: Maintains digital versions of sustainability standards and requirements
- **Self-Assessment**: Facilitates supplier documentation of sustainability practices
- **Evidence Repository**: Stores supporting documentation for compliance claims
- **Gap Analysis**: Identifies areas of non-compliance requiring remediation
- **Improvement Tracking**: Monitors progress toward full standards adherence

### 3. Audit Scheduling Contract

Coordinates and manages regular sustainability compliance verification activities.

- **Audit Calendar**: Automates scheduling based on risk factors and certification requirements
- **Auditor Assignment**: Matches qualified inspectors with appropriate assessment tasks
- **Methodology Management**: Defines required verification procedures for different standards
- **Notification System**: Alerts relevant parties about upcoming and overdue audits
- **Resource Planning**: Optimizes auditor time and reduces redundant assessments

### 4. Certification Contract

Manages authenticated sustainability claims and formal certifications.

- **Certification Registry**: Creates verifiable digital certificates for approved claims
- **Expiration Management**: Tracks validity periods and renewal requirements
- **Scope Definition**: Clarifies exact boundaries of certified attributes or facilities
- **Chain of Custody**: Traces certified materials throughout processing and manufacturing
- **Suspension Protocols**: Manages certificate validity during compliance investigations

### 5. Consumer Verification Contract

Enables end-user confirmation of product sustainability claims and attributes.

- **Product Authentication**: Verifies individual item sustainability credentials
- **Claim Verification**: Validates specific environmental and social impact assertions
- **Transparency Reporting**: Presents sustainability data in consumer-friendly formats
- **Impact Quantification**: Translates sustainability efforts into tangible metrics
- **Feedback Collection**: Gathers consumer input on sustainability priorities

   ```

3. **Deploy Smart Contracts**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   npx hardhat deploy --network [network_name]
   ```

4. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

## Sustainable Sourcing Verification Lifecycle

1. **Supplier Onboarding**: Vendor establishes verified identity on the platform
2. **Standards Selection**: Applicable sustainability frameworks are mapped to supplier operations
3. **Self-Assessment**: Supplier documents current practices and provides evidence
4. **Third-Party Verification**: Independent auditors validate sustainability claims
5. **Certification Issuance**: Verified claims receive digital certification credentials
6. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Regular audits maintain certification validity
7. **Consumer Access**: End users verify product sustainability through digital interfaces
